# downsampling_in_deep_ISR
Deep image super resolution is the process of up-
scaling images with deep neural networks. Downsampling is a
critical step in this process, where a high-resolution image is
converted to a low-resolution version in order to be processed by
a deep learning model for training. The quality of the resulting
super-resolution image depends heavily on the complexity and
effectiveness of the downsampling method used in creating a
low resolution training set. In this research, we compare several
different downsampling methods in the context of deep image
super resolution. The explored downsampling methods include
linear interpolation, bilinear interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, lanczos filter, bicubic interpolation, hamming window
and box filter. We first provide a qualitative comparison of
each downsampling method used on images with varying upscale
factors, and then provide an empirical study with quantitative
results to demonstrate that linear interpolation, the hamming
window, and lanczos filter work best for training super image
resolution models.
